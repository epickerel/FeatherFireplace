# FeatherFireplace

I needed a fireplace simulation for a project using the 15x7 Charliewing, and couldn't find anything procedural/random that looked good enough in monochrome. Therefore, this is a simple 100 frame capture of an actual fireplace.

Very loosely based on [FeatherCandle](https://github.com/wbphelps/FeatherCandle). This doesn't use the compression techniques used by that project, as I'm on an Arduino Uno compatible with plenty of space. I've attached the monochrome GIF (generated with [EZGif](https://ezgif.com/)), so that others might implement their own compression methods.
